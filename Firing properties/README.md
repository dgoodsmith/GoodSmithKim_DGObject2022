Firing properties:
For both All cells (all 366 cells analyzed in this study) and cells with place fields ("active"; at least one field in at least one session):
- All are provided as 366 cells (rows) by 10 columns (sessions)

* spinfo: spatial information score (in bits/spike)
* peakrates: peak firing rate
* meanrate: mean firing rate
* infop: p value for spatial information score
* rmap: speed filtered, 48x64 pixel firing rate maps
* fieldnum: number of detected place fields
* active_cells: 
  * 0 - cell has no place fields
  * 1 - cell has place field in at least one session
  
  cells with fields are further separated by cell type
